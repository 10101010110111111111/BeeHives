# BeeTracker Project Documentation

## Overview
BeeTracker is a comprehensive beekeeping management system designed to help beekeepers track and manage their beehives, tasks, and team members. The system supports multi-user operations with role-based access control and real-time data synchronization.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Main.java** - Application entry point
2. **ProgramLoop.java** - Main application logic and user interface
3. **DataManager.java** - Handles data persistence and file I/O operations
4. **User Management** - User authentication and role management
5. **Hive Management** - Beehive tracking and management
6. **Task Management** - Task assignment and tracking

### Key Classes

#### User.java
Represents a user in the system with the following attributes:
- Username and password for authentication
- Real name for identification
- Role (admin or employee)
- Assigned tasks

#### BeeHive.java
Represents a beehive with comprehensive tracking capabilities:
- Unique ID and tag information
- Location tracking
- Status monitoring (healthy, needs attention, queenless, empty)
- Honey level percentage
- Queen presence tracking
- Required actions list
- Notes and history

#### Task.java
Represents a task in the beekeeping system:
- Unique ID and descriptive name
- Detailed description
- Location association
- Status tracking (pending, in progress, completed)
- Creation and completion timestamps
- Notes field for additional information

#### DataManager.java
Handles all data persistence operations:
- File-based storage using DataFile.txt
- Concurrent access control with read/write locks
- File locking for data integrity
- Real-time change detection
- Default data initialization

### Features

#### Multi-User Support
- Role-based access control (admin/employee)
- Secure login system
- Different permission levels for various operations

#### Hive Management
- Add, update, and track beehives
- Monitor hive health and status
- Track honey production levels
- Queen presence management
- Location-based organization

#### Task Management
- Create and assign tasks
- Track task progress and completion
- Location-based task organization
- Overdue task detection

#### Real-Time Data Synchronization
- File modification detection
- Automatic data reloading
- Concurrent access protection
- Data consistency across multiple instances

#### Multithreading
- Background data saving operations
- Non-blocking user interface
- Concurrent task processing
- Thread-safe data operations

### User Roles

#### Administrator (admin)
- Full system access
- Manage hives (add, update, delete)
- Create and manage tasks
- View all system statistics
- Manage user accounts

#### Employee (employee)
- View assigned tasks
- Complete tasks
- View hive details
- Update hive information
- Add notes and observations

### Data Persistence

#### Storage Format
Data is stored in a plain text file (DataFile.txt) with the following structure:
```
===USERS===
username|password|name|role

===LOCATIONS===
location_name

===HIVES===
NEXT_HIVE_ID:id
hive_id|tag_number|tag_color|location|status|honey_level|has_queen|notes
ACTIONS:hive_id
action_description
ENDACTIONS:hive_id

===TASKS===
NEXT_TASK_ID:id
task_id|name|description|location|status|notes
```

#### Concurrency Control
- Read/Write locks for thread safety
- File locking for multi-process access
- Automatic change detection
- Graceful error handling

### Installation and Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command line or terminal access

#### Compilation
```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java
```

#### Execution
```bash
java -cp bin Main
```

### Default Users
1. Admin User:
   - Username: pavel
   - Password: password123
   - Name: Pavel
   - Role: admin

2. Employee Users:
   - Username: worker1
   - Password: worker123
   - Name: Worker One
   - Role: employee

   - Username: worker2
   - Password: worker123
   - Name: Worker Two
   - Role: employee

### Sample Data
The system initializes with sample data including:
- 3 locations: Forest Location, Meadow Location, Garden Location
- 5 hives with various statuses
- 3 tasks for demonstration

### Error Handling
- File I/O error handling
- Data parsing error recovery
- Default data initialization on missing files
- Graceful degradation on system errors

### Security Considerations
- Plain text password storage (for demonstration purposes)
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Concurrent access protection

## Development Information

### Technology Stack
- Core Java (no external frameworks)
- Standard Java I/O operations
- Java Concurrency utilities
- File-based data storage

### Code Structure
- Object-oriented design
- Single responsibility principle
- Thread-safe operations
- Clean separation of concerns

### Extensibility
- Modular design allows for easy feature additions
- Well-defined interfaces for each component
- Clear data model for extensions
- Standard Java practices for maintainability

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Application
1. Compile the source code
2. Run the Main class
3. Log in with provided credentials

### Navigation
- Use numeric menu options to navigate
- Press Enter to continue after operations
- Follow on-screen prompts for data entry

### Multi-Instance Operation
- Multiple instances can run simultaneously
- Data changes are automatically synchronized
- File locking prevents data corruption
- Real-time updates across all instances

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Compilation errors**: Ensure JDK is properly installed and PATH is configured
2. **File access errors**: Check file permissions for DataFile.txt
3. **Concurrency issues**: System handles most cases automatically
4. **Missing data file**: System will create default data on first run

### Support
For issues with the system, check:
- Java installation and version
- File permissions in the application directory
- Available disk space
- System resources for thread execution
